The key is to start simple, explaining each part of the code and gradually expanding into the larger picture.

Slide 1: Introduction

Briefly introduce the topic of the presentation, i.e., analyzing stock prices using Python.
Explain what the program does: It gets stock price data from Yahoo Finance, analyzes it, and visualizes it with various types of plots.

Slide 2: Setup and Data Retrieval

Briefly introduce the yfinance package and its purpose - to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.
Explain the code that sets the start and end date and the ticker symbol for Amazon.
Describe how the data is retrieved using the download function.

Slide 3: Data Exploration

Explain the purpose of printing the last 5 rows of the data.
Introduce Matplotlib and its purpose in this project - for plotting the data.
Show an example of what the plot of 'Adj Close' looks like and explain what 'Adj Close' means.

Slide 4: Autocorrelation of Daily Returns

Explain what daily returns are and how they are calculated.
Define autocorrelation and its significance in time series analysis.
Discuss how autocorrelation is calculated in the code and then shown with a plot.

Slide 5: Retrieving Data for Multiple Stocks

Explain the process of fetching data for multiple tickers.
Show the DataFrame that contains 'Adj Close' prices for all these stocks.
Display the plot showing all these prices over time.

Slide 6: Pearson Correlation Coefficients

Define Pearson correlation coefficients and their significance.
Show the correlation matrix and how it's calculated.
Introduce seaborn and its use in the project, specifically for visualizing the correlation matrix and for creating pairwise scatter plots.
Display the heatmap and explain how to interpret it.
Show the scatter plots and discuss what they reveal about the relationships between different stocks' daily returns.

Slide 7: Conclusion and Q&A

Summarize the main points of the presentation.
Discuss potential extensions of this analysis, such as using these correlations to diversify a portfolio or predicting future prices.
Open up for questions and discussion.
